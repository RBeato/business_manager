# Marketing Strategy — Single Source of Truth

> **Last updated**: February 2026
> **Goal**: Maximize revenue across 6 projects as a solopreneur with ~€150/month budget
> **Constraint**: 4-5 hours/day available, organic-first approach

## 1. Portfolio Overview

| Project | Type | Platform | Status | Strategic Role |
|---------|------|----------|--------|----------------|
| HealthOpenPage (HOP) | AI health tracker + creator economy | iOS, Android, Web | Beta (95%) | Primary wealth engine |
| MeditNation | AI meditation, 10 languages | iOS, Android, Web | Production | Scalable subscription brand |
| RiffRoutine | AI practice routine generator | Web | Live | SEO hub + traffic funnel |
| Guitar Progression Generator | Chord progression tool | iOS, Android | Live | Cash flow (bundle) |
| Scale Master Guitar | Scales/modes reference | iOS, Android | Live | Cash flow (bundle) |
| Ear'n'Play | Ear training | iOS, Android | Live | Cash flow (bundle) |

**Key insight**: The path to revenue is **HOP > MeditNation > RiffRoutine as ecosystem**, not 6 apps growing evenly. Guitar apps should be bundled under one brand.

## 2. Market Context

| Market | Size (2026) | CAGR | Top Players | Indie Opportunity |
|--------|-------------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Wellness/Health Apps | $12.87B | 15.1% | MyFitnessPal ($310M), Noom ($1B) | Lab analysis niche underserved |
| Meditation Apps | $1.82B | 18.1% | Calm ($300M), Headspace ($348M) | AI personalization + multilingual |
| Music Education | $3.79B | 14.4% | Yousician ($4.8M/yr), Fender Play | Practice routines niche open |
| Guitar Apps | $325M | 3% | Yousician, Simply Guitar | Bundled tools + SEO funnel |

**Reality check**: Calm raised $218M+ and has 4M subscribers. Headspace has 1,456 employees. As a solo indie, reaching $9M in 3 years has ~1-3% probability. Realistic Year 3 combined profit: $65-90K (sequential launch strategy).

## 3. Project Ranking

| Rank | Project | Probability | Why | Barriers |
|------|---------|-------------|-----|----------|
| 1 | HealthOpenPage | Medium | Largest market ($12.87B), B2B potential, highest ARPU ($15-18/mo), unique lab analysis + creator marketplace | Complex (42 tables, 107 endpoints), 45-70 hrs/week needed, HIPAA concerns |
| 2 | MeditNation | Medium | Production-ready, better retention (8% vs 4%), lower complexity, 20-30 hrs/week | Hyper-competitive (Calm/Headspace own 43% share), AI features copyable |
| 3 | Guitar Bundle | Medium (niche) | Your domain expertise, multiple live apps, underserved practice routines niche | Needs unified brand, smaller market |
| 4 | RiffRoutine | High (as hub) | SEO weapon, cross-promotion engine, compounds over time | Not a standalone revenue product |
| 5 | Scale Master | Low-Medium | Synergy with bundle | Commoditized, crowded |
| 6 | Ear'n'Play | Low-Medium | Niche winner potential | Brutal competition, retention challenges |

---

## 4. Resource Allocation

| Project | Time/Week | Budget/Month | Role |
|---------|-----------|--------------|------|
| HealthOpenPage | 45% | €50 | Wealth engine — validate, then scale |
| MeditNation | 25% | €30 | Subscription brand — ASO + short-form video |
| RiffRoutine | 15% | €20 | Traffic + SEO funnel |
| Guitar Apps (all) | 15% | €20 | Bundle + cash flow |

---

## 5. Revenue Projections (Realistic)

### Conservative Scenario (Solo, Organic-First)

| Project | Year 1 (2026) | Year 2 (2027) | Year 3 (2028) | 3-Year Total |
|---------|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| HealthOpenPage | $5,000 | $25,000 | $60,000-$90,000 | $90K-$120K |
| MeditNation | $2,000 | $10,000 | $40,000-$70,000 | $52K-$82K |
| Guitar Bundle | $1,000 | $5,000 | $20,000 | $26K |
| **Total** | **$8,000** | **$40,000** | **$120K-$180K** | **$168K-$228K** |

**Assumptions**: Freemium subs at $8-15/month, 3-15% conversion, 25-40% retention. All apps new with minimal traction.

### MeditNation vs HOP Head-to-Head

| Metric | MeditNation | OpenPage |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Cost per install | $20 | $22 |
| Free-to-paid conversion | 3.5% | 3.0% |
| 30-day retention | 8% | 4% |
| ARPU | $9.99/mo | $15-18/mo |
| LTV (Year 3+) | $120-180 | $180-280 |
| Year 3 net profit | $30-40K | $35-50K |
| Dev time needed | 20-30 hrs/week | 45-70 hrs/week |
| Year 5 valuation | $500K-$1.5M | $1.5M-$3M |

**Verdict**: MeditNation = safer, simpler. OpenPage = higher upside but 2-3x the work.

---

## 6. Launch Strategy: Sequential (Recommended)

Running both HOP and MeditNation simultaneously requires 75-133 hrs/week -- physically impossible solo. Sequential launch delivers 2-3x better outcomes with half the work.

| Phase | Focus | Expected Outcome |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **Year 1** | MeditNation (full focus) + Guitar bundle (maintenance) | -$6K loss, 8 paying customers, proven marketing playbook |
| **Year 2** | Add HOP (full focus), MeditNation on autopilot | MeditNation break-even ($450 MRR), HOP -$4K (14 customers) |
| **Year 3** | Scale winners only | Combined $65-90K profit |

## 9. 90-Day Action Plan

### Phase 1: Weeks 1-4 (Prep & Organic Base, ~€50)

- [ ] **Unify guitar brand**: Reposition RiffRoutine.com as "Guitar Practice System" hub. Link all apps as features. Add email signup for free PDF routine.
- [ ] **ASO overhaul (all apps)**: Update titles/keywords/screenshots per recommendations above. Use free AppTweak trial for keyword research. Expect 2-5x organic lift.
- [ ] **Directory submissions**: RiffRoutine to Product Hunt, AlternativeTo, BetaList, IndieHackers. MeditNation to AppAdvice.
- [ ] **Content kickoff**: 3 guitar posts/week on r/guitarlessons (value-first with tool embed). 1 MeditNation tip post.
- [ ] **Remove fake testimonials** from all websites. Replace with beta invite CTAs.

### Phase 2: Weeks 5-8 (Test & Iterate, ~€50)

- [ ] **Community deep dive**: 10 value comments/day in guitar subreddits/forums. Cross-link subtly. Target: 100 emails, 50 installs.
- [ ] **Paid test**: €40 Apple Search Ads on 2 high-intent guitar keywords. Measure LTV:CAC (need >2:1 to scale).
- [ ] **Email nurture**: Weekly guitar tips newsletter, free via Mailchimp. CTA to paid apps.
- [ ] **Metrics check**: Track downloads/revenue. Pivot if guitar conversion <10%.

### Phase 3: Weeks 9-12 (Amplify Winners, ~€50)

- [ ] **Scale winner**: If guitar MRR >€200, reinvest 50% into micro-guitar YouTubers (€20-50/post).
- [ ] **Cross-promo**: Guitar hub footer links to MeditNation ("Musician mindfulness").
- [ ] **Validate HOP**: Get 5 beta users via personal network. If 0 paid intent, park it.
- [ ] **KPI targets**: 500+ guitar emails, €500 MRR total, 20% retention.

## 10. Positioning & Monetization

### HOP -- "Health Data OS" (not "another app")
- Subscription: €7-15/month consumer, pro tiers for power users
- Future: B2B dashboards (clinics, corporate wellness) = highest leverage
- Position as private beta for serious self-optimizers

### MeditNation -- "Meditation for [specific identity]"
- Not "another meditation app" -- pick an identity angle:
  - Musicians & creatives
  - People who hate woo-woo
  - Mental clarity for builders
- Subscription only: €5-10/month, push annual plans hard
- Hook: "Meditation for people who can't meditate"

### Guitar Apps -- "RiffTools Suite"
- Bundle all 3 under one brand: Progressions + Scales + Ear Training
- One shared subscription OR lifetime unlock (€20-40)
- 100% driven by ASO + RiffRoutine SEO funnel
- No paid ads, no influencer spend

## 11. Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target (Year 1) | Target (Year 3) |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Total downloads | 1,000+ | 10,000+ |
| Email subscribers | 500+ | 5,000+ |
| Monthly recurring revenue | €500 | €5,000+ |
| Free-to-paid conversion | 5%+ | 10%+ |
| 30-day retention | 15%+ | 25%+ |
| LTV:CAC ratio | >2:1 | >4:1 |
| App Store rating | 4.0+ | 4.5+ |

---

## 12. Indie Case Studies (Reference)

| App | Result | Key Tactic |
|-----|--------|------------|
| HabitKit | $10K MRR, $600K+ total | App Store features, MKBHD shoutout, consistent updates |
| ConvertKit | $3M/month ($45M/year) | Freemium, content marketing, niche focus |
| Wave AI | $450K/month | AI trends, rapid iteration, solo coder |
| ShipFast | $133K/month | IndieHackers, bundling products |
| Incredibox | ~€10M total | Niche appeal, solo dev |

Common pattern: Launch often, iterate on feedback, cross-promote, focus on one winner.

---

## 13. Critical Decisions Needed

1. **Sequential vs simultaneous**: Launch MeditNation Year 1, add HOP Year 2 (recommended) vs trying both now
2. **Guitar bundle brand**: Finalize name ("RiffTools Suite"?) and shared pricing
3. **MeditNation positioning**: Pick one identity angle and commit
4. **HOP pricing tiers**: Fix broken $199.99/year annual plan (should be ~$69.99/year)
5. **Kill criteria**: If <100 users after 6 months on any project, park it
